=====================================
Duality AI Space Station Hackathon Submission

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
----------------
We have successfully developed a complete Space Station Object Detection System using YOLOv8 
and synthetic data from Duality AI's Falcon platform. The system can detect three critical 
safety equipment items: Fire Extinguishers, Tool Boxes, and Oxygen Tanks.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
-------------------------
1. MACHINE LEARNING:
   - Model: YOLOv8s (Ultralytics)
   - Training: 10 epochs, 7.8 hours on CPU
   - Performance: 89.3% mAP50 accuracy
   - Inference Time: 588ms
   - Classes: FireExtinguisher (93.7%), ToolBox (91.3%), OxygenTank (82.8%)

2. BACKEND (Python/Flask):
   - RESTful API with 5 endpoints
   - SQLite database for detection history
   - Robust image processing (JPG/PNG/AVIF support)
   - CORS enabled for frontend integration

3. FRONTEND (Angular 15):
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Real-time object detection interface
   - Chart.js analytics dashboard
   - Detection history and settings

KEY FEATURES:
